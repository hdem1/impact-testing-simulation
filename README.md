# impact-testing-simulation
This is a repository to store code for the NASA Impact senior design project. The project's goals are to be able to reliably test impacts on heat shield tiles between 5 and 100 m/s. This repository contains analysis scripts which should allow faster design iteration with concrete numbers to use when discussing trades and other design decisions.
